# 30-Projects in 30-Days

These are the mini web projects using HTML, CSS & JS done by myself while doing a course in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/). <br>

I got this course during a giveaway luckily so I want to warm my skills on this basic components :) <br>
I will update it daily and try my best to complete in 50days.
